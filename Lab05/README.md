Tristen Miller. He helped me with figuring out how to test my 
LinkedLists because the concept still feels foreign to me. He also 
helped me with a lot of debugging headaches.

### Result of Timing Experiment ###
InsertionSort() did prove to be faster. This was what I was expecting,
because InsertionSort() had far less to compare against while iterating
through the loop while every iteration of SelectionSort() had to compare
all items every time.

### Summary ###
The goal of the lab was to create a linked list which we could then
manipulate for various uses. Linked Lists utilize a lot of pointers.

My approach was just to define all of my functions first. From there I
created all my tests so I could troubleshoot everything at once. When I
had errors, I would go through all of my definitions affected until I found
my errors and corrected them. On occasion if I was stuck, I would consult
with my colleague and together we would discuss potential errors.

### Last thoughts ###
I think in the end this lab was pretty straightforward and not too bad.
I think it was a nice change of pace, and I thoroughly enjoyed this lab
though I will admit that the pointer references is still a bit challenging
for me to wrap my mind around.
