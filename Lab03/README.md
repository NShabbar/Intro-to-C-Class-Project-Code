Tristen Miller, helped me refine some of my problematic equations 
with debugging and talking out dilemmas. Helped me understand the difference 
between global and local variables that caused issues in later functions, and
the concepts of inverse matrices.

### What was the point of this lab? ###
The point of this lab seemed to be creating functions of Matrices in 
such a way that by the end you would eventually have to use other parts 
of the functions in order to finish the rest. By doing so, a person had 
to be aware of differences with local variables and global variables or 
else they would encounter trouble in the future. The programmer also 
needed to be aware how to implement test functions.
	
### What was your approach to this lab? ###
My approach to this lab was a lot of crying. Jokes aside, it was trying
a very difficult lab for me. I needed help initially in understanding this lab
conceptually because I saw the wall of text and felt paralyzed. After talking it
over with my buddy, I was able to get cracking on defining my functions. I wrote
all of my functions first--which we were not supposed to do--but I never wrote a 
test function before and just couldn't handle the idea so did not want to bother
until I was done defining my functions.

After I defined my functions I then removed them all and placed them on a 
separate file while I wrote my accompanying test functions. This was tricky to me
because it was conceptually something new to me and new terrifies me, but here we
are. Most of the tests were fairly easy. It wasn't until the end when I got to the
SubMatrix that I felt like my life was falling apart. I could not get it to work...
turns out my code was right in structure, but I had been using the same variables
I had used in multiple functions and since this function called helper functions
it became a nightmare. After creating separate variables it remedied the situation.
I had the same problems with Inverse.

I would say the weakness' of my code is I still don't understand pointers and
probably could have written cleaner code if I used them. I guess if I did this lab
again that is what I'd want to try.

### Feedback ###
I did not enjoy this lab. Conceptually I understand why it was important.
However, I feel like this lab was too long. I feel like some of the functions
we created could have honestly been skipped. I think I spent in total 20 hours
on this lab, and while it may be easy from the stand point of a professional or
someone with lots of coding experience this was insanely tedious for me. There was
so much redundancy for writing the tests and functions that it took up too much
time. I suggest removing any unnecessary functions that don't get used in the
last function, and cutting down testing requirements... As in test the first and
last two as they are most important.

My frustration does stem from that this lab took so long while only having
a short deadline to do, and while 20 hours is nothing in the scale of a full time
job I think faculty and such forget that this is not the only class most students
take. Imagine if my other two classes also took 20 hours a week to finish. That
makes my "work" week now 60 hours. I am also unfortunately one of many
students who also have to maintain a job to survive so I also work 20-25 hours a
week. I will round down. That makes my "work" week now 80 hrs. That is not much
time left to eat, socialize, relax, sleep, etc. which are all important things
to experience. I understand having to work hard and do forgo most of those
things already in order to meet my important tasks, but I would appreciate
consistensy. Last week's lab only took three hours. If you have read this far,
then thank you for reading my rant, and I hope you will consider the changes
I suggested above.
