# Summary: #
In this lab, we learned how to interact with the hardware with
our coding, and how to interact multiple functions all together.

# Approach: #
My approach to this lab was nonexistant. I struggled with this
lab immensely, and in the end I don't think I even did the lab
correctly, but it was still an interesting lab none the less.
I did a lot of googling to read up on concepts when I didn't
understand what particular functons or ideas meant. Part 1-3
all felt relatively straight-forward. Part 4 was where I felt
like I hadn't the faintest clue what I was doing, and part 5
was a true nightmare. I ended up getting part 4 to mostly work
though I will admit there are still issues I could not hammer
out such as getting the button to say up right after down
without causing the button to always display up. For part 5,
I just could not get the switch to interact with the buttons
or the LEDs, but I did manage to get the buttons to mildly work
with the LEDS.

A note for part 3: The display for whatever reason would not
turn on until I turned the knob.

A note for part 4: I read in the manual it needed to be cast
to the Oled, which is what my first iteration did--however,
upon being told by the TA I needed to print it to the hardware
terminal and not the LED, I did that instead.

I think I spent a total of twenty painful hours on this lab.
