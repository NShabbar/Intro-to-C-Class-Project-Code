### Collaborators: ###
Tristen Miller whom I discussed deubigging with and the difference uses
of fseek and fgets. I also assisted him in how to get his input to properly
read inputs that were more than one character as invalid. I had assistance
from the TA Aidan on how to read a bit map for how the text rooms can be read.

### Summary ###
The main goal of this lab seemed to be how to read and open files, and how
to use all the commands with File.I/O.

### Approach ###
I approached this lab in not the best way. I started by trying to do everything,
and had to stop. I ended up defining my Players document first, then attempting
main before realizing I needed to define game after player. I ended up using
player in games so I am glad I defined player first then I left main for last.

I ran into some trouble making the Makefile, but that is where the TA also
helped me out. Turns out it was more simple than I had thought. I also ran into
trouble debugging, but I ended up needing to do a bunch of printf's to see
what the values of my fgetcs for my rooms.North/etc. After figuring that out
I was able to edit my code to better target the appropriate characters. I am
not sure I got it a hundred percent correct... but it seemed to work well
enough.

### Final Thoughts ###
I really enjoyed this lab. It was fun, something I have wanted to do for a long
time, and something I feel I would use in the future. I think my solutions and code
works, but I never know until it's graded because it seems to work fine, but maybe
I didn't test it well enough. I think the lab manual could be expanded upon, though.
Like a map of the bits laid out in the text file would be incredibly helpful. A
TA had one and it made a night and day difference, honestly.
