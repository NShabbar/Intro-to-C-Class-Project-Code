##Questions:##
#What happens if the line "scanf(" ");" executes? Why?#
	When this line executes, it will search for a user's input and store
	it. Doing so means the input can be used elsewhere in the code.
	For example, in our lab, we used it to compare the input against
	which function we wished to run by comparing the input to function
	operands.
	
#In this lab, we forbid you from using printf() or scanf() inside of certain functions.#
#Explain why a rule like this is useful.#
	This is useful because we have to think of where else to put the code in
	order to retrieve the necessary info. Since it could not be utilized
	in the functions, the commands had to be utilized in our if-else statements
	which allows a user to always be able to input new operands.

#How long did this lab take you? Was it harder or easier than expected?#
	This lab took me about two hours and twenty minutes. It was easier than
	I initially expected, but still a decent challenge.
