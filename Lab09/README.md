### What extra Credit Was Done: ###
AI beats staff AI 75% of time.
Negotiations cheat.

Load the microcontroller with the correct.o files with our files, and just run the program.

### Collaborators: ###
My partner, and Aidan the Tutor, and Andrew the tutor.

### Overview: ###

The battleboats uses two different state machines to run with a total of four different files.
There is an overall state machine that utillizes all three files in order to run the game,
by reading messages, hashes, and encryptions.

As far as I can tell everything works pretty well. We compiled everything and had no errors.
We also ran everything against their corresponding .os so if the tests passed those and our
written code we assumed it was likely in good order. My partner also then ran our system on
the microcontroller to test it and it seemed to work.

We had some trouble with our coding. Most of it was trial and error but utilizing the correct.os
really helped with testing.

I learned a lot from this lab. I learned a bit about NMEA which was a mind boggling event.
The decoding function was the most difficult part.

I liked this lab a lot, even though it was a headache. I don't think I would change anything
about it except for maybe the testing of Agent. The microcontrollers and the .py files were
a real pain, but I didn't have any luck with it so my partner worked with that mostly.
