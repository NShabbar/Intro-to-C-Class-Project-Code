### Collaborators: ###
Tristen Miller, and Aidan the TA. They both helped me with troubleshooting.

### Summary ###
This lab was an entirely event based driven assignment. We learned about
FSMs and how to implement them.

My approach to this lab was to read what I could about everything, but as
always I feel incredibly lost like I don't know what I am doing or what
anything means.

### Problems ###
I had problems with two things. One I was able to resolve (Mostly) and the
other I could not solve no matter what I did.

The solved problem: My timer and temperature were tied together. I solved
this by separating the two with an input state. However, my timer goes far
beyond the max, which I believe is 4:16 minutes/seconds.

The unsolved problem: If Button four is pressed when there is no cook time
set it will kill itself and you have to rerun the program. It is fine if
you have cook time.
