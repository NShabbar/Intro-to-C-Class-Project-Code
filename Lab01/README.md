# Note:
I think I actually had to run this 5 times in
order to get my program to reach the point where the
breakpoint is not reached anymore.

# Part 1 Note:
The lines that were changed between the formatting
changes were:
Lines 12-15, Line 17, Lines 23 and 24, Line 31, Line 36

# Final thoughts:
I enjoyed this lab though I had some trouble getting the programs
to work. After I got those to work I think every thing was fairly
smooth sailing. I had trouble with my OLED in that it wrote once,
and although the only changes I made were what it wrote, I couldn't
get it to print anymore. I made several mistakes in this lab,
and used the help of the tutors (both were fantastic) and the TA Navid
who was also incredibly helpful. They were able to guide me through
any errors I had.
