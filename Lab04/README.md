In this lab, I had the help of Tristen in regards to discussing the different type of ways to
point to an item. I also had Tristen and Aidan's help in regards to helping me debug my code when
I would run into errors.

## How was the lab? ##
I thought this lab was challenging but not as bad as the last one. This is a good lab.

## Approach ##
I approached this lab with a lot of of worry because I am still confused about pointers, and they
stress me out. However, the more I worked on the assignment the more I felt I eventually got it, but
I would say it was still difficult. I read the manual quite a bit and looked at other examples of
RPN calculators--though my coding was vastly different from what I saw online. I ran into trouble
with getting my tests to work, and what not. I think my divide zero is still a bit incomplete, but
I could not figure out how to get it to work in the end. I also couldn't get my errors in the
actual character to stop displaying even when it actually worked.

## Results ##
I think my RPN definitions were as good as they can be, but kept running into issues with the divide
by zero. In the end, I ran out of time and had to move on. Every thing else seemed to function correctly.
The other issue I had was when my calculator would run, it would return a result then an error, and I
think it was because it ran out of things in the stack to run so would always return that no matter
what. I ran out of time and could not fix this.
